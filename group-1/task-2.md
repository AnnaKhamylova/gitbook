# Task 2

Notes before we start:

1. Fields' = body params, not query params.
2. How can we uderstand on which profile we should update data â€” it must be unique field, maybe email or special id. Or we should use query params? It is a key point. If we keep email as unique field, I guess there will be no opportunity to update it. So, let's say it's unique and can not be changed.
3. Usually we use limits for password, like: minimum 8 characters, must contain letters, digits and special symbols.
4. Password and confirmPassword must be equal and it is sensitive to layout of keyboard.
