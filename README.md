  bug report written in English, listing all identified issues and estimating
  their severity.

# Before all

Before we start, I think it would be important to note seversl things:

* **Requirements**. It is impossible to test something without any info about requirements. Tester does not just report random bugs — they are looking for differencies between the requirement and actual behavior. Since there is no specification for this task, I will base on my previous experience. I will write down all nuances to make the chain of my thoughts clear for you.
* **Process and communication**. This point is connected to previous one. So if it was a real feature to test, I would read all documentation or ask some questions. Sometimes there is no analytics or docs for feature — in this case I would read epic or ask the developer of feature. Sometimes I ask even product manager or QA team lead — it really depends.
* **Severity**. I do not know your scale system for severity and priority or any other system that you use to report bugs. So in this task I will use my own rate system for severity: low, meduim, high. If I struggle somewhere with this system, I will note that.&#x20;
